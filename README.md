# Simple Snake Game on ESP32

This is my first IOT project deployed with PlatformIO, so do provide feedback if you do have any!

The objective of this project is to learn about the project structure of a typical Arduino program, followed by these technical aspects:
- basics of C++ language (as I'm a beginner)
- how the setup and loop functions run within an Arduino program
- global variables
- input initialization

### Materials I Used
- ESP32 Wroom Module
- SSD1306 OLED display
- 5 push buttons
- Wires and breadboard

### PlatformIO environment & Setup
